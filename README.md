# Insect-Bite-Recognition
Final Year Project for Graduation

Few things i want to add up:
1. MATLAB code, used MATLAB R2015a to create it.
2. Used Neural network Tool in MATLAB to create classifier.
3. Used GLCM to extract features (Could have used something better but limited time)
4. Dimensionality Reduction using PCA.

Any questions i come up, i will keep updating this readme.
